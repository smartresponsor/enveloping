## 2026-09-23 — repository bootstrap

- Created the standalone Enveloping Git repository under the workspace root.
- Consulted the current Objecting package surface for Symfony 8.1 / PHP 8.4 packaging conventions without importing Objecting responsibilities.
- Selected a transport-agnostic milestone: immutable Envelope mechanics, typed contextual attributes, a deliberately small generic vocabulary, Symfony Bundle/DI integration, and unit tests.
- Explicitly excluded Doctrine persistence, CRUD, Symfony Messenger coupling, consumer-specific attributes, domain-component knowledge, and arbitrary JSON metadata bags.
- Material risks: premature vocabulary growth and accidental coupling to consumers.
- Gates run: Composer install PASS; composer validate --strict PASS; PHPStan level=max PASS; PHPUnit PASS (4 tests, 11 assertions); final Git status/diff inspection pending commit.
- Acceptance state: initial transport-agnostic Enveloping core is implementation-complete for the bootstrap milestone; remote publication remains intentionally pending.
